# Levelhead-Custom-Campaigns
A Godot game used to create custom campaigns and bookmark levels for Levelhead using the Rumpus API.
## The Purpose
The purpose of the Custom Campaigns is to host the Community Campaign as well as other user-made campaigns in the future!
## The ToDo List
**There's many things left to do, so I decided to make a list here:**
1. ~~Saving and Loading~~
   * ~~Save custom campaigns as JSON~~
   * ~~Save progress made on other user's custom campaigns~~
   * ~~Load levels from JSON file~~
   * ~~Implement the UI for all of these~~
2. Add missing map features
   * ~~Add visual map nodes~~
   * Maybe add VEND-Rs
   * Add ~~scale~~ and rotation properties
   * Add Level Orb visuals (~~change by biome~~, show missing collectibles near orb)
3. Extend Rumpus API functionality
   * Save delegation key -> online only so far
   * ~~Get user information from delegation key~~
   * Get level names from the API
4. Community Campaign
   * Add as a Seperate option from own and other people's levels
   * Maybe add custom stuff if people want to
5. Refactoring, reorganizing
   * Finding a sensible way to store all of the scenes and pictures
   * Change level_id to use the node name instead (guarantees it being unique)
6. Campaign Editor
   * Implement drag n drop
   * Implement menus to change all relevant values
   * Add a convenient way to share levels
7. UI
   * Add button for copying level code
   * Make window size responsive
   * Explanations and Delegation Key related stuff
